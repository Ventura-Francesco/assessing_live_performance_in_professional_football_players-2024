## Abstract
Statistics is already playing a crucial role in gaining a competitive edge in professional football. This study explores a novel methodology to assess the physical performance of football players, both during and post-game. The methodology was applied to highly accurate data regarding seasons 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 of one Premier League club.  

The main focus is to analyse the extreme values of absolute acceleration, which are then compared to the ones of the playerâ€™s nearest counterpart on the opposing team in order to identify under- or overperformance in real-time or post-game. Extreme observations were selected using Peak Over Threshold (POT) analysis and compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test.  

This methodology offers a tool to facilitate the evaluation of physical performance, which can lead to more informed decision-making processes. Some concrete live decisions it could help with are player substitutions or tactical changes, while it could assist long-term with adjustments of the playerâ€™s role in the team or their skill development plan.
